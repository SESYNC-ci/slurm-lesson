## High-performance computing with Slurm

This lesson describes how to use a [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com) high-performance computing cluster to run your code in parallel.
The lesson covers submitting job scripts directly and through the [rslurm](https://cyberhelp.sesync.org/rslurm) package. 
The lesson is tailored to SESYNC's cluster so it may not work well on other systems depending on how Slurm is configured; YMMV.
